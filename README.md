  <summary>[Malware] Zerion Solution</summary>
  For this challenge, participants are provided with a file named <code>zerion</code>.<br><br>
  At first glance, the contents of this file reveals some PHP code.<br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/vAJmHp2.png"><br><br>
  Digging in a little farther, there seems to be some encoded text at the end of the file.<br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/pnB0T5D.png"><br><br>
  In the first screenshot, the variable <code>$L66Rgr</code> is being assigned to an array containing the php code and the base64 string at the end of the file.<br><br>
  Specifically, the explode function is splitting the current file by the string <code>?></code> which would isolate the base64 string into the second element of the array.
  The array should look similar to this:<br><br>
  
  `[php_code, base64_text]`<br><br>
  
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/u0WLJKE.png"><br><br>
  A little further along the code is this variable `$L6CRgr`. Here, an array is created as so:<br><br>
  
  `[/x/i, x, base64_text]`<br><br>
  
  The first two arguments are just decoded base64 text. The third element is what we want to pay more attention to. It's doing some stuff to the second element of the array created before.<br><br>
  Following the function call, first run the third element of the array (base64 text at end of file) through a rot13 decoder.<br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MYvLDUF.png"><br><br>
  Then take the output and reverse the string.<br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/tJnesuQ.png"><br><br>
  Then we get, surprise surprise, base64 text. Run that through a base64 decoder.<br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/YxBvzRf.png"><br><br>
  Now we're getting somewhere...<br><br>

  After searching through more php code, the flag is captured!

  <summary>[Forensics] Traffic Solution</summary>
  <b>~~ NOTE: It's easier to complete this challenge within a Linux environment. ~~<br><br></b>
  For this challenge, participants are provided with a file called <code>traffic.7z</code>.<br><br>
  After extracting the file, reveals a bunch of gzip files<br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/0N4uQeJ.png"><br><br>
  The naming convention of the files suggests these are zeek logs. <a href="https://docs.zeek.org/en/master/script-reference/log-files.html" target="_blank">More Info</a><br><br>
  After extracting the gzip files, we can now spin up a database using <a href="https://github.com/activecm/rita" target="_blank">Rita</a><br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/oxjtWe1.png"><br><br>
  <code>rita import . logs</code> will create a database including all the files in the present working directory and name it logs.<br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/jfZONRr.png"><br><br>
  <code>rita show-beacons logs -H</code> will spit out some data to look at. We can already see some suspicious looking connections based on how many were made. However, this format is hard to read and doesn't really show much.<br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/PPQ9RPI.png"><br><br>
  Running the command <code>rita html-report logs</code> will create an organized html report for us.<br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/x07K0Gt.png"><br><br>
  Looking at the Beacons, there are several outgoing connections that seem to be repeated more than usual. Along with a score that is VERY close to 1, this raises some red flags. Even more so with the highlighted IP.<br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/8xqe2rV.png"><br><br>
  Trying to access the IP directly reveals this is pointing to some github url. 104 connections being made to one github link? Something isn't right.<br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/hFkSOxm.png"><br><br>
  Switching to the Beacons SNI page, and searching for any github urls we find a github pages link.<br><br>

  Voil√†! Flag is captured :-)

  <summary>[Malware] Hot Off The Press Solution</summary>
  Participants are provided with a file <code>hot_off_the_press</code>. In the metadata of the file we see it's UHA compressed file.<br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Qyw8oZD.png"><br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/KfrOOka.png"><br><br>
  Using <a href="https://sam.gleske.net/uharc/" target="_blank">UHARC Cmd</a> we can extract the files provided we give the supplied password <code>infected</code> found on the challenge site.<br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/YQ5XU4B.png"><br><br>
  The extracted file seems to be a <code>.ps1</code> Powershell file.<br><br>
  Going inside the file, we see some gzip and base64 happening to a provided string that is being concatenated.<br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/2gdDxKb.png"><br><br>
  Going to the end of the string, we see that the string is first being decompressed using <a href="https://www.gzip.org/" target="_blank">gzip</a>, then decoded using Base64.<br><br>
  Looking closer, there is the <code>-f</code> Powershell string format specifier with replacement happening with 'L' and 'E'. This will be important further along...<br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/fpOB1F7.png"><br><br>
  Copying the string into a new file, we can start to clean it up and make sense of it. First, by removing all instances of <code>'+'</code> since it's purely Powershell code and has nothing to do with the actual string.<br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/IlhFid0.png"><br><br>
  Next we can remove <code>'</code>. It's safe to assume it doesn't have anything to do with the string.<br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/mreTC4e.png"><br><br>
  Remember the replacement with 'L' and 'E' mentioned before? Here it comes into play. There are several <code>{0}</code> and <code>{1}</code> placements throughout the string. Now, we can replace every <code>{0}</code> with L and every <code>{1}</code> with E.<br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/z3QjLNX.png"><br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/STlzFpx.png"><br><br>
  Following the function call of the original Powershell code, put the cleaned up string into a gzip decompressor.<br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/aPfObPj.png"><br><br>
  We have some more powershell code, and from first glance there doesn't seem to be anything interesting.<br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/0S71jd9.png"><br><br>
  Until we notice a very long Base64 string.<br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZA6PQJf.png"><br><br>
  Just copy and paste the string into a Base64 decoder and the flag is captured!

  <summary>[Forensics] Backdoored Splunk Solution</summary>
  For this challenge, participants are provided with a zip file containing some files used for Splunk Add-on for Windows.<br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/lNbC6oe.png"><br><br>
  We want to direct our attention to the bin folder since these files were deemed suspicious. By viewing a certain powershell file within <code>bin/powershell/nt6-health.ps1</code> we can see a web request being made to the provided container on the challenge site.<br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/t9eG782.png"><br><br>
  This web request includes an authorization header which is important to note... If we go to the challenge site we are met with this json message.<br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/oHyw4Z2.png"><br><br>
  Now we can craft a HTTP GET request to the site adding in the authorization header with the value we found from the powershell file.<br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/NG6ypYq.png"><br><br>
  You can use any tool you want to do this. Personally, I'm using <a href="https://www.postman.com/" target="_blank">Postman</a> because it's simple and gets the job done, but other tools like <a href="https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload" target="_blank">Burp Suite</a> should work fine.<br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ugyyO3i.png"><br><br>
  Once the request is sent, the server responds back with some Base64 encoded text inside a HTML comment.<br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/kOpgJf7.png"><br><br>
  Decode the text using your favorite tool, and flag captured!

  <summary>[Misc.] Rock, Paper, Psychic Solution</summary>
  <br>
  Participants are provided with a 7zip archive which contains an exe file. Using DIE we can see it's a 64-bit exe file.<br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/DHQGhPs.png"><br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/n2EN0IO.png"><br><br>
  From the entropy analysis page, the binary seems to not be packed, which makes our job a lot easier.<br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/VLP83uF.png"><br><br>
  Next open the binary in a dissassembler and begin to look for any interesting strings. I'm using <a href="https://hex-rays.com/ida-free/" target="_blank">IDA Freeware</a><br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/QWPfcF3.png"><br><br>
  Here we can see several interesting strings that have to do with the gameplay along with some interesting Hex and seemingly random string of characters.<br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/NPZOsXu.png"><br><br>
  Clicking into the Hex string, we see it's referenced in a function called <code>printFlag</code>.<br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/TbAd2VE.png"><br><br>
  Searching through the function, it will lead you to a <code>fromRC4</code> function and then to a <code>genKeystream</code> function. Now we have an understanding that the flag is not hardcoded in the binary, rather it's generated at run time. To investigate further, we need a debugger.<br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/wtbUMcI.png"><br><br>
  Before going further, take note of the address where <code>printFlag</code> is since we can try to trigger it during run time.<br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/fLXDO0W.png"><br><br>
  Open the binary in a debugger of your choice, I'm using <a href="https://x64dbg.com/" target="_blank">x64dbg</a><br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/s3J7v5k.png"><br><br>
  Run through the game, and the instruction will go to a different location in memory. We can exploit this by changing the next instruction to jump to the location of <code>printFlag</code> we saved earlier. Instruction should look similar to <code>jmp 0x4168F0</code>. Your address might be different.<br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/gyxkfoj.png"><br><br>
  Continue with execution, and if done properly, flag should appear. Well done!
