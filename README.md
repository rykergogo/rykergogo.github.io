  <summary>[Malware] Challenge Zerion Solution</summary>
  For this challenge, participants are provided with a file named <code>zerion</code>.<br><br>
  At first glance, the contents of this file reveals some PHP code.<br><br>

  Digging in a little farther, there seems to be some encoded text at the end of the file.<br><br>

  In the first screenshot, the variable <code>$L66Rgr</code> is being assigned to an array containing the php code and the base64 string at the end of the file.<br><br>
  Specifically, the explode function is splitting the current file by the string <code>?></code> which would isolate the base64 string into the second element of the array.
  The array should look similar to this:<br><br>
  
  `[php_code, base64_text]`<br><br>

  A little further along the code is this variable `$L6CRgr`. Here, an array is created as so:<br><br>
  
  `[/x/i, x, base64_text]`<br><br>
  
  The first two arguments are just decoded base64 text. The third element is what we want to pay more attention to. It's doing some stuff to the second element of the array created before.<br><br>
  Following the function call, first run the third element of the array (base64 text at end of file) through a rot13 decoder.<br><br>

  Then take the output and reverse the string.<br><br>

  Then we get, surprise surprise, base64 text. Run that through a base64 decoder.<br><br>

  Now we're getting somewhere...<br><br>

  After searching through more php code, the flag is captured!

  <summary>[Forensics] Challenge Traffic Solution</summary>
  For this challenge, participants are provided with a file called <code>traffic.7z</code>.<br><br>
  After extracting the file, reveals a bunch of gzip files<br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/0N4uQeJ.png"><br><br>
  The naming convention of the files suggests these are zeek logs. <a href="https://docs.zeek.org/en/master/script-reference/log-files.html" target="_blank">More Info</a><br><br>
  After extracting the gzip files, we can now spin up a database using <a href="https://github.com/activecm/rita" target="_blank">Rita</a><br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/oxjtWe1.png"><br><br>
  <code>rita import . logs</code> will create a database including all the files in the present working directory and name it logs.<br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/jfZONRr.png"><br><br>
  <code>rita show-beacons logs -H</code> will spit out some data to look at. We can already see some suspicious looking connections based on how many were made. However, this format is hard to read and doesn't really show much.<br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/PPQ9RPI.png"><br><br>
  Running the command <code>rita html-report logs</code> will create an organized html report for us.<br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/x07K0Gt.png"><br><br>
  Looking at the Beacons, there are several outgoing connections that seem to be repeated more than usual. Along with a score that is VERY close to 1, this raises some red flags. Even more so with the highlighted IP.<br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/8xqe2rV.png"><br><br>
  Trying to access the IP directly reveals this is pointing to some github url. 104 connections being made to one github link? Something isn't right.<br><br>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/hFkSOxm.png"><br><br>
  Switching to the Beacons SNI page, and searching for any github urls we find a github pages link.<br><br>

  Voil√†! Flag is captured :-)
